# Public Speaking Journey 

This repo contains talks and resources for embarking on your journey to becoming an established public speaking in tech. It is based on the experiences of the author [Carly Richmond](https://github.com/carlyrichmond), who embarked on her own speaking journey after taking 6 month maternity leave in 2019. The resources referenced have been presented at several forums including:

1. [Women Coding Community (formerly Women Who Code London), March 2023](https://womencodingcommunity.com/)
2. [European Women in Technology, June 2023](https://europeanwomenintech.com/)
3. [codebar festival 2024](https://festival.codebar.io/)

A sample recording is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoW9IKr9HSQ).

## Resources

Check out [RESOURCES.md](./RESOURCES.md) for a full list of external resources, communities and videos that you can use to improve your public speaking skills. 

If you have taken part in a recent workshop, the worksheet and slides are available [in the workshop folder](./workshop/).
